1. SpouseName is used over SpouseID.
Reason is due to complexity if each FamilyMember's data is added one by one into the database without the data of what the SpouseID will be, requiring  subsequent post-insert operation updates to update the SpouseID.


2. Grant Assumptions
*A household can qualify for more than 1 grant
*Less than or More than is not inclusive of the number. eg less than 16 means 15 and below.
*No proof of parents of children qualifying for grants living in the same household is required.
*Return data follows the same format as endpoint No.2 List Household
*Streamlined the Scheme parameters to use the 5 scheme types as an input parameter instead of specifying age and total income.
